# CapstoneProject

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- **`npm start`**  
  Runs the app in development mode.  
  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
  The page will reload when you make changes, and any lint errors will appear in the console.

- **`npm test`**  
  Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
  See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

- **`npm run build`**  
  Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.  
  The app is optimized for the best performance, and filenames include hashes.

  See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

- **`npm run eject`**  
  **Note**: This is irreversible.  
  It copies all configurations and dependencies into the project for complete control.
